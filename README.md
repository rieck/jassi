jassi - A Simple and Robust JavaScript Lexer
==

README
--

Jassi is a minimalistic lexer for JavaScript code. The lexer is simple but
robust enough to deal with the usual JavaScript madness in websites. In
fact, Jassi will lex anything that roughly looks like JavaScript, including 
C and PHP. ;)

I am not very proud of it. Have fun.

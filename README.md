A Simple and Robust JavaScript Lexer
Copyright 2011 (c) Konrad Rieck (konrad@mlsec.org)

Jassi is a minimalistic lexer for JavaScript code. The lexer is simple but
robust enough to deal with the usual JavaScript madness in websites. In
fact, Jassi will lex anything into JavaScript tokens, even C or PHP code.
